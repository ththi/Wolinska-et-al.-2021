# Wolinska-et-al.-2021

This repository includes raw-data and scripts, used in Wolinska et al, 2021.

Most Scripts are written by Katarzyna W. Wolinska. 

Main Microbiome data is included in the folders for Fig2 and Fig4_gh.

Please note: We changed genotype names for apex1/2/3 to hub1, apex and hub2. 
To be consistent with the sequencing (meta)data, this is only done within R scripts.
